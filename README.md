# StatisticalProject
Statistical Learning Project

This project explores the factors influencing flight delays, specifically focusing on flights arriving at JFK Airport. By applying statistical learning methods, the goal is to predict and classify whether a flight will be delayed, using various factors such as departure delays, weather conditions, and aircraft age.
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes all civil flights in the USA for 2023.

Throughout the analysis, both regression and classification models were used. Polynomial regression emerged as the best performer for predicting arrival delays, while Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA were applied for classification tasks, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy.
